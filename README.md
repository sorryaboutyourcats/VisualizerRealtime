sorryaboutyourvisualizer

Very early build of the MixPlay controlled visualizer.

When playing it from Unity, it will ask you to connect it to your Mixer account - after that, you should be able to control different aspects of the visualizer from your MixPlay board [you don't have to be streaming].

Not all buttons work, because things are constantly changing, so don't bother with reporting bugs as, again, this is nowhere near done.
